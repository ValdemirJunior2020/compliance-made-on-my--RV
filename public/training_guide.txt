If the reservation is prepaid, confirm that the hotel has the payment and the client should not receive a receipt from the hotel but that we would be sending it via email and text.
If the front desk agent does not find the reservation:

[Slide 8]
What to obtain at the HOTEL?
•If the hotel has agreed to a full refund on a penalized or non-refundable booking, ask for cancellation number, folio, front desk name and position.
•If the hotel says they cannot provide a folio or that the folio is blank simply advise the hotel to send an email to Folio@hotelplanner.com
•Please ask that the email includes; Guest first and last name, and the message “this reservation was cancelled free of charge/ without penalty“.

[Slide 9]
BILLING AND REFUND TICKET
“We will be raising a ticket for our Tickets Team to review your concern. They will be reaching out to you as soon as possible through your email. May I confirm your email address. Is it _________?”

[Slide 10]
•For some scenarios the guest insists on having the refund immediately, advise the guest that “We will escalate your request (follow escalation matrix). We advise that it may take 2-10 business days depending on your bank.”
•For some scenarios that guest insists on having the voucher immediately (Check the FIT to see if voucher was issued). Immediate voucher requests should only be made for same-day re-bookings where hotel denied lodging or agent error. For same day check-in re-book the guest in a new transaction. (Recommended Pay at Hotel) For guests that will not be checking in on the same day but need to make their next reservation, offer to re-book immediately in a new transaction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Slide 1]
Disputed Reservations
Disputes:
Once a dispute has been opened on a reservation, we are unable to issue any refund until the dispute has been closed. Closure of a dispute takes up to 90 days, but the guest is able to provide written documentation of the closure of the dispute in order to move on to grant a possible refund. This is subject to the merchant approval as well.
Our ispute team will then work with our merchant to get the dispute removed from the booking so that the Escalations Team can work on obtaining authorization for any pending refund.
Requests for status updates on disputed reservations can also be sent to this email – chargereview@hotelplanner.com

[Slide 2]
How to proceed for Unrecognized Charges
If you CAN ﬁnd the RSV:
Resend a copy of the confirmation via email and text.
If you CANNOT ﬁnd the RSV:
If a Client receives a charge that they do not recognize and you’re unable to pull up a RSV with the information provided, ask them to email Proof of Charge (could be a screenshot of the charges on their CC Statement) to: reservations@hotelplanner.com

[Slide 3]
Charges without a RSV
If a client calls because they were trying to make a booking, and they got charged but the reservation wasn’t completed successfully, you’ll need to advise the client that if the charge is still Pending it will disappear in the next 24 - 48 hours. If the charge is Posted after the 48 hours, they will need to send a copy of the charge or bank statement to reservations@hotelplanner.com.
If at the time of the call, the charge has posted out of their account, they need to send it right away to the same email. Please ask the guest to kindly add a brief explanation of what happened and the screenshot of the charges.

[Slide 4]
Unrecognized RSVs
Sometimes, you’ll receive a call from a Client that received a text message notiﬁcation conﬁrming a RSV. Whenever this happens, validate the information on the RSV and conﬁrm with the Guest if they receive a charge to their CC related to that RSV.
If the Client has been charged for it, and the email on the RSV does not belong to them, you can ask them to submit the screenshot of the charges to our reservations@hotelplanner.com email adding the details of the RSV to easily identify it.
If the Guet hasn’t been charged, verify the phone number in our RSV is the same as the guests. Advise them the information received was sent in error to their phone number .

[Slide 5]
Duplicate Charges
Sometimes, you’ll receive a call from a Guest that has been charged multiple times for the same reservations or the hotel has charged the guest a second time for a prepaid reservation. When this happens, please request a screenshot of both charges to be replied to the ticket that will be created by using the “Double Charge” dropdown.

[Slide 1]
Introduction to Group Requests and Extended Stay Requests
This process is where we complete an RFP (Request for Proposal) to our hotel partners requesting discounted group rates or lower nightly rates depending on the guest’s length of stay.
The form is completed for both types of requests in a similar fashion by asking the guest a few simple questions and gathering their contact information and email address to view these quotes.
The guest will have a dedicated point of contact (assigned planner) that is an expert in the hotel market for that region. They are also eligible for a voucher , should they choose to book through us and utilize one of our hotel options. If the caller is a travel agent, they may be eligible for a commission in lieu of a voucher.
The overall process is to assist the client with obtaining the best available rates from the hotels that meet their needs by using rate-checking technology.

[Slide 2]
Group Requests
A Group Request is when a guest is requesting quotes for discounted pricing for 9+ rooms. This can be made for one specific hotel or multiple hotels in their desired destination for a specified group event.
These discounted quotes are sent to the guest via their email account when the Group Request is completed. The guest will be able to create future requests should they need to under their Account Settings.

[Slide 3]
How does a Group Request work?
Group Requests can be submitted for 9+ Rooms
(Exceptions being New York City or Las Vegas, which require 10+ rooms for a group rate)
If a Guest is looking for less than 9 rooms, 5 - 8 rooms, increase the number to 9 rooms on the form to get the request to go through. This will allow the guest to receive group rates and provide access to our individual rates should they not want to sign a contract with the hotel. Anything less than 5 rooms, the guest is welcome to book on the Individual Sales Platform. As an agent you can assist them with this new hotel reservation.
Once the Request has been submitted, the platform will notify the chosen Hotel/Hotels of the request. The Hotels will then provide the lowest available group rate to the guests via email. Allow the hotels up to 24-48 hours to reply with their rates.
Once the request has been submitted the guest will receive an email in next 15 minutes. The guest can login to their request to view the quotes from the hotel/hotels using their email address and the password we will have provided to them.
The guest can choose any available rate by selecting “Contact Hotel”, this will provide the guest with the direct contact information of the Hotel Sales Manager to finalize the details of the Group Block.
Once the Group Block is finalized the group coordinator (normally the person calling about the group request) can send the hotel info to the guests to finalize and pay for their room or in some cases the coordinator will pay for the rooms. This all depends on the hotel options.

[Slide 4]
Extended Stays
What is an Extended Stay Request?
An Extended Stay Request is when a guest is needing a single room or multiple rooms, for an extended period of time, i.e. 14+ days. (examples are work crews, traveling medical professionals, college students…etc)
Exception: Hotels.com and Priceline.com require 28 days or more to submit a request on their platform to get the discounted rates.
By completing the RFP (Request for Proposal) the same one that is used for the Group Requests , the guest will receive discounted rates from the hotel of their choice as well as other hotels located within that city.
The difference between a Group Request and an Extended Stay request are the Length of Stay and the number of rooms requested by the guest.

[Slide 5]
LOCATION
CHECK-IN AND OUT DATES
NUMBER OF ROOMS
DO NOT SUGGEST TO A GUEST ANY OF THIS SET INFORMATION CAN BE MODIFIED ONCE SUBMITTED. If the guest needs to change any of these, they will have to submit a “New Request” in their account,. The guest can login and select “New Request”. DO NOT OFFER TO DO THIS UNDER A NEW EMAIL.
Important Details
Once a Request has been successfully submitted, there are important request details that cannot be modiﬁed, such as:

[Slide 6]
Scripting
MUST DO’s:
Group Calls / Extended Stays Ownership:
“Yes, I can assist you with getting the lowest available rates for this Group Request (or) Extended Stay Request;
what city and state can I assist you with?"
Take all the mandatory information of the Form:
City and State for Destination
Check-In and Out
# of Rooms
Room Type
Group Type
Meeting Space (Yes/No)
Additional Request
Email
Phone Number
Full Name.
Verify the Email Address and Guest Full Name using NATO Phonetic Alphabet.
A full recap of the information must be completed.
Explain how the process will work for the Guests:
“Your request has been submitted. You will be receiving an email within the next 15-30 minutes. Once you receive this email from your assigned planner, you will be able to login and view the available group rates. Your login is your email address that you just provided, and the password is (PROVIDE THE PASSWORD). Also your Request ID is (PROVIDE THE REQUEST ID)
I do recommend giving the hotels at least 24 hours to respond, as these rates will be coming directly from the on site Sales Managers. Feel free to select any of the bids provided to you. Once accepted you will have the name, number and email for that local Sales Manager should you have any questions or would like to go ahead and set up your block.
Do you have any further questions? Thank you for calling and have a wonderful day. “

[Slide 7]
Overcoming Objections
When a guest asks if they are speaking with the hotel directly, we can reply with the following examples to overcome the possible objection:
"What I’m able to do for you is provide the best group rates for the hotels in this city and these group rates will be sent to you via email”
"This is a free service with no obligation. We can save you time by providing discounted rates from your preferred hotel, in addition to other hotels in that area. “
"This is where you can see pricing for different properties and once you make a decision on which hotel best ﬁts your group, you will be able to conﬁrm all the ﬁner details with the hotel of your choice."

[Slide 8]
Extended Stays
Select the HotelPlanner :: English option of the Drop-Down menu to be able to complete the RFP (Request for Proposal)
Same Day or within 24 hours of check-In, agents can do the following:
Because hotels can take 24-48 hours to respond to the RFP, offer to book the guest for immediate check-in through the individual platform ; while submitting the request for 4 days later.
If the request is for multiple rooms , we can book the rooms immediately through the individual platform for 8 or less rooms at a time. If more than 10 rooms place the guest on a brief hold and call the hotel to verify the availability.

[Slide 9]
Booking in a Block
What to do if a guest wants to book within an existing block of rooms:
Assist by offering to book the room as an individual reservation at the current rate that is available for their preferred hotel.
If the guest objects to the current rate, and would like to stay with the group block, advise the guest to contact the group coordinator to obtain the booking instructions for their group block (we do not have access to these blocked rates). These instructions may be in the communications received from the coordinator about the group block.
If guest is unaware of who the group coordinator is, mention that the coordinator is the person in their group that set up the block for them. This information may be in an email they received that notified them of the group block for the event, or it may be on an event page for their group.

[Slide 10]
Group Promo Vouchers
Eligible group bookings are sent a voucher after the stay. These are sent to the group coordinator, and this is done in order to:
Thank the customer for booking their group request thru HotelPlanner.
Ensure that the group coordinator submits a copy of their receipt to HotelPlanner in order for us to collect our commission from the hotel.

Vouchers
When Guest cancels with or without penalty and they want to rebook without paying again.
When Hotel approved a cancellation with or without penalty for a Non-Refundable RSV.
Vouchers can be generated by having them submitted to the refund queue. Agents will have to request the voucher to rebook the guest.
Vouchers contain a 16-digit number (similar to a credit card number) and a 6-digit PIN
Immediate voucher requests should be sent through Slack “General” channel. (Same-day re-booking)
Voucher will be valid for 120 days from the date of issuance.
Vouchers can only be used for Pay Now type of RSVs.
If the reservation amount is > than the amount of the voucher, guests will be able to pay the difference on the check-out page.
If the unused voucher amount is > $50 USD , a new voucher for the difference will be automatically sent to the email address on file.
A voucher is HotelPlanner credit, used to apply funds toward a new reservation made on our platform.

[Slide 2]
Vouchers
The Voucher is used as a gesture of good will for issues occurring generally beyond our control.
